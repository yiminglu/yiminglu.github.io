I don't know why....

Why am I like this?
Why do I have such kind of nature?
How did I leave those who I care sad?

Are all these caused by those things which had happened to me?

I do really think I had come across too many things,
which is beyond my imagination...

How can I stop it?

I had been thinking about this many times.
Only to find that nothing came up in my mind...

I had an empty head, just as the empty heart I'd.
The only way to forget all these sorrows may be
A COMPLETELY SUNK INTO OBLIVION...

Who knows me?
Many people.
Who knows about me?
God knows...

I really deserve a lose...
Except for this, I deserve nothing.

All can leave.
Leave me alone.
